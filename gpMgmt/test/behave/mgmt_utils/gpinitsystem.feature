Feature: gpinitsystem tests
    @gpinitsystem_checksum_on
    Scenario: gpinitsystem creates a cluster with data_checksums on
        Given the database is initialized with checksum "on"
        When the user runs "gpconfig -s data_checksums"
        Then gpconfig should return a return code of 0
        And gpconfig should print "Values on all segments are consistent" to stdout
        And gpconfig should print "Master  value: on" to stdout
        And gpconfig should print "Segment value: on" to stdout

    @gpinitsystem_checksum_on
    Scenario: gpinitsystem generates an output configuration file and then starts cluster with data_checksums on
        Given the cluster config is generated with data_checksums "on"
        When the user runs command "gpinitsystem -a -c ../gpAux/gpdemo/clusterConfigFile -O /tmp/output_config_file"
        And gpinitsystem should return a return code of 0
        Then verify that file "output_config_file" exists under "/tmp"
        And verify that the file "/tmp/output_config_file" contains "HEAP_CHECKSUM=on"
        And the user runs "gpinitsystem -a -I /tmp/output_config_file -l /tmp/"
        Then gpinitsystem should return a return code of 0
        When the user runs "gpconfig -s data_checksums"
        Then gpconfig should return a return code of 0
        And gpconfig should print "Values on all segments are consistent" to stdout
        And gpconfig should print "Master  value: on" to stdout
        And gpconfig should print "Segment value: on" to stdout

    @gpinitsystem_checksum_off
    Scenario: gpinitsystem creates a cluster with data_checksums off
        Given the database is initialized with checksum "off"
        When the user runs "gpconfig -s data_checksums"
        Then gpconfig should return a return code of 0
        And gpconfig should print "Values on all segments are consistent" to stdout
        And gpconfig should print "Master  value: off" to stdout
        And gpconfig should print "Segment value: off" to stdout

    @gpinitsystem_checksum_off
    Scenario: gpinitsystem generates an output configuration file and then starts cluster with data_checksums off
        Given the cluster config is generated with data_checksums "off"
        When the user runs command "gpinitsystem -a -c ../gpAux/gpdemo/clusterConfigFile -O /tmp/output_config_file"
        And gpinitsystem should return a return code of 0
        Then verify that file "output_config_file" exists under "/tmp"
        And verify that the file "/tmp/output_config_file" contains "HEAP_CHECKSUM=off"
        And the user runs "gpinitsystem -a -I /tmp/output_config_file -l /tmp/"
        Then gpinitsystem should return a return code of 0
        When the user runs "gpconfig -s data_checksums"
        Then gpconfig should return a return code of 0
        And gpconfig should print "Values on all segments are consistent" to stdout
        And gpconfig should print "Master  value: off" to stdout
        And gpconfig should print "Segment value: off" to stdout
