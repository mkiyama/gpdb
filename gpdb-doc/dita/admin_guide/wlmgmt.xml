  <shortdesc>Greenplum Database workload management helps you prioritize and allocate resources to
    queries according to business requirements and to prevent queries from starting when resources
    are unavailable.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>Using workload management, you can limit the number of concurrent queries, the amount of memory used to execute a query, and the relative amount of CPU devoted to processing a query. Greenplum Database provides two schemes to manage workload and resources - Resource Queues and Resource Groups.</p>
      <note type="warning">Resource group-based workload management is an experimental feature and is not intended for use in a production environment. Experimental features are subject to change without notice in future releases.</note>
    <p>Either resource queue-based or resource group-based workload management is active in Greenplum Database; both schemes can not be active at the same time.</p>
    <p>Resource queue-based workload management is enabled by default when you install your Greenplum Database cluster. While you can create and assign resource groups when resource queues are active,
    you must explicitly enable resource groups to start using that workload management scheme.</p>

    <p>The following table summarizes some of the differences between Resource Queues and Resource Groups.</p>
