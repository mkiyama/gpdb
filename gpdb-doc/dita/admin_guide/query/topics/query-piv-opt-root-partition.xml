  <title>Collecting Root Partition Statistics</title>
  <shortdesc>For a partitioned table, GPORCA uses statistics of the table root partition to generate
    query plans. These statistics are used for determining the join order, for splitting and joining
    aggregate nodes, and for costing the query steps. This is in contrast to the legacy planner,
    which uses the statistics of each leaf partition. If you execute queries on partitioned tables,
    you must collect statistics on the root partition and periodically update those statistics to
    ensure that GPORCA can generate optimal query plans. </shortdesc>

    <title>Running ANALYZE</title>
    <body>
      <p>Running the <codeph>ANALYZE</codeph> or <codeph>ANALYZE ROOTPARTITION</codeph> command
        samples the leaf partition data in a table, and stores the statistics for the root
        partition. <codeph>ANALYZE</codeph> collects statistics on the root and leaf partitions,
        including HLL statistics on the child leaf partitions. <codeph>ANALYZE
          ROOTPARTITION</codeph> collects statistics only on the root partition, the leaf partition
        data is only sampled. See the <codeph><xref
            href="../../../ref_guide/sql_commands/ANALYZE.xml#topic1">ANALYZE</xref></codeph>
        command for information about collecting statistics on partitioned tables.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that <codeph>ANALYZE</codeph> and <codeph>ANALYZE ROOTPARTITION</codeph>
        always scan the entire table before updating the root partition statistics. If your table is
        very large, this operation can take a significant amount of time. <codeph>ANALYZE
          ROOTPARTITION</codeph> also uses an <codeph>ACCESS SHARE</codeph> lock that prevents
        certain operations, such as <codeph>TRUNCATE</codeph> and <codeph>VACUUM</codeph>
        operations, during execution. For these reasons, you should schedule <codeph>ANALYZE
          ROOTPARTITION</codeph> operations periodically, or when there are significant changes to
        leaf partition data.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that even if the root partition statistics are not up-to-date or do not exist,
        GPORCA will still perform dynamic partition elimination for queries against the table.</p>
      <p>Follow these best practices for running <codeph>ANALYZE</codeph> or <codeph>ANALYZE
          ROOTPARTITION</codeph> on partitioned tables in your system:<ul id="ul_vm4_fsn_wbb">
          <li>Always run <codeph>ANALYZE</codeph> or <codeph>ANALYZE ROOTPARTITION</codeph> at least
            once for each newly-created partitioned table, after adding initial data. You can run
              <codeph>ANALYZE</codeph> on a new leaf partition. If the other leaf partitions have
            statistics, the command updates the root partition statistics.</li>
          <li>Update root partition statistics when you observe query performance regression in
            EXPLAIN plans against the table, or after significant changes to leaf partition data.
            For example, if you add a new leaf partition at some point after generating root
            partition statistics, consider running <codeph>ANALYZE</codeph> or <codeph>ANALYZE
              ROOTPARTITION</codeph> to update root partition statistics with the new tuples
            inserted from the new leaf partition.</li>
          <li>For very large tables, run <codeph>ANALYZE</codeph> or <codeph>ANALYZE
              ROOTPARTITION</codeph> only weekly, or at some interval longer than daily.</li>
          <li>Avoid running <codeph>ANALYZE</codeph> with no arguments, because doing so executes
            the command on all database tables including partitioned tables. With large databases,
            these global <codeph>ANALYZE</codeph> operations are difficult to monitor, and it can be
            difficult to predict the time needed for completion.</li>
          <li>Consider running multiple <codeph>ANALYZE &lt;<varname>table_name</varname>></codeph>
            or <codeph>ANALYZE ROOTPARTITION &lt;<varname>table_name</varname>></codeph> operations
            in parallel to speed the operation of statistics collection, if your I/O throughput can
            support the load.</li>
          <li>You can also use the Greenplum Database utility <codeph>analyzedb</codeph> to update
            table statistics. Using <codeph>analyzedb</codeph> ensures that tables that were
            previously analzyed are not re-analyzed if no modifications were made to the leaf
            partition.</li>

    <title>GPORCA and Leaf Partition Statistics</title>
    <body>
      <p>Although creating and maintaining root partition statistics is crucial for GPORCA query
        performance with partitioned tables, maintaining leaf partition statistics is also
        important. If GPORCA cannot generate a plan for a query against a partitioned table, then
        the legacy planner is used and leaf partition statistics are needed to produce the optimal
        plan for that query. </p>
      <p>GPORCA itself also uses leaf partition statistics for any queries that access leaf
        partitions directly, instead of using the root partition with predicates to eliminate
        partitions. For example, if you know which partitions hold necessary tuples for a query, you
        can directly query the leaf partition table itself; in this case GPORCA uses the leaf
        partition statistics.</p>

    <title>Disabling Automatic Root Partition Statistics Collection</title>
    <body>
      <p>If you do not intend to execute queries on partitioned tables with GPORCA (setting the
        server configuration parameter <codeph><xref
            href="../../../ref_guide/config_params/guc-list.xml#optimizer_analyze_root_partition"
            >optimizer</xref></codeph> to <codeph>off</codeph>), then you can disable the automatic
        collect statistics on the root partition of the partitioned table. The server configuration
        parameter <codeph><xref
            href="../../../ref_guide/config_params/guc-list.xml#optimizer_analyze_root_partition"
            >optimizer_analyze_root_partition</xref></codeph> controls whether the
          <codeph>ROOTPARTITION</codeph> keyword is required to collect root statistics for the root
        partition of a partitioned table. The default setting for the parameter is
          <codeph>on</codeph>, the <codeph>ANALYZE</codeph> command can collect root partition
        statistics without the <codeph>ROOTPARTITION</codeph> keyword. You can disable automatic
        collection of root partition statistics by setting the parameter to <codeph>off</codeph>.
        When the value is <codeph>off</codeph>, you must run <codeph>ANALZYE ROOTPARTITION</codeph>
        to collect root partition statistics.</p>
