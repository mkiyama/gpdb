      <p>Greenplum Database is installed with an optional module of encryption/decryption
        functions called <codeph>pgcrypto</codeph>. The <codeph>pgcrypto</codeph>
        functions allow database administrators to store certain columns of data
        in encrypted form. This adds an extra layer of protection for sensitive
        data, as data stored in Greenplum Database in encrypted form cannot be
        read by anyone who does not have the encryption key, nor can it be read
        directly from the disks.</p>
      <note>The <codeph>pgcrypto</codeph> functions run inside the database server,
        which means that all the data and passwords move between
        <codeph>pgcrypto</codeph> and the client application in clear-text. For
        optimal security, consider also using SSL connections between the client
        and the Greenplum master server.</note>

            scope="external">pgcrypto</xref> in the PostgreSQL documentation for more information
          about the individual functions in this module.</p>
