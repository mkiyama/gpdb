title: Configuring PXF Hadoop Connectors (Optional)
---

PXF is compatible with Cloudera, Hortonworks Data Platform, and generic Apache Hadoop distributions. This topic describes how configure the PXF Hadoop, Hive, and HBase connectors.

*If you do not want to use the Hadoop-related PXF connectors, then you do not need to perform this procedure.*

## <a id="client-pxf-prereq"></a>Prerequisites

PXF bundles all of the JAR files on which it depends, including those for Hadoop services, and loads these JARs at runtime. Configuring PXF Hadoop connectors involves copying configuration files from your Hadoop cluster to each Greenplum Database segment host. Before you configure PXF Hadoop, Hive, and HBase connectors, ensure that you can copy configuration files from HDFS, Hive, and HBase hosts in your Hadoop cluster to the Greenplum Database master host.

In this procedure, you copy Hadoop configuration files to the `$PXF_CONF/servers/default` directory on each Greenplum Database segment host. PXF creates this directory when you run `pxf cluster init`.

## <a id="client-pxf-config-steps"></a>Procedure

Perform the following procedure to configure the desired PXF Hadoop-related connectors on each segment host in your Greenplum Database cluster.


You will use the `gpscp` utility where possible to copy files to multiple hosts.

1. Log in to your Greenplum Database master node:

    ``` shell
    $ ssh gpadmin@<gpmaster>
    ```

2. PXF requires information from `core-site.xml` and other Hadoop configuration files. Copy relevant configuration from your Hadoop cluster to each Greenplum Database segment host.

    1. Copy the `core-site.xml`, `hdfs-site.xml`, `mapred-site.xml`, and `yarn-site.xml` Hadoop configuration files from your Hadoop cluster NameNode host to the current host using your tool of choice. For example, this command uses `scp` to copy the files:

        ``` shell
        gpadmin@gpmaster$ cd $PXF_CONF/servers/default
        gpadmin@gpmaster$ scp hdfsuser@namenode:/etc/hadoop/conf/core-site.xml .
        gpadmin@gpmaster$ scp hdfsuser@namenode:/etc/hadoop/conf/hdfs-site.xml .
        gpadmin@gpmaster$ scp hdfsuser@namenode:/etc/hadoop/conf/mapred-site.xml .
        gpadmin@gpmaster$ scp hdfsuser@namenode:/etc/hadoop/conf/yarn-site.xml .
        ```
        
    2. Next, copy these Hadoop configuration files to each Greenplum Database segment host. For example, if `PXF_CONF=/etc/pxf/usercfg`:

        ``` shell
        gpadmin@gpmaster$ gpscp -v -f seghostfile core-site.xml =:/etc/pxf/usercfg/servers/default/core-site.xml
        gpadmin@gpmaster$ gpscp -v -f seghostfile hdfs-site.xml =:/etc/pxf/usercfg/servers/default/hdfs-site.xml
        gpadmin@gpmaster$ gpscp -v -f seghostfile mapred-site.xml =:/etc/pxf/usercfg/servers/default/mapred-site.xml
        gpadmin@gpmaster$ gpscp -v -f seghostfile yarn-site.xml =:/etc/pxf/usercfg/servers/default/yarn-site.xml
        ```

2. If you plan to use the PXF Hive connector to access Hive table data, similarly copy Hive configuration to each Greenplum Database segment host.
    
    1. Copy the `hive-site.xml` Hive configuration file from one of the hosts on which your Hive service is running to the current host. For example:

        ``` shell
        gpadmin@gpmaster$ scp hiveuser@hivehost:/etc/hive/conf/hive-site.xml .
        ```

    2. Next, copy the `hive-site.xml` configuration file to each Greenplum Database segment host. For example:

        ``` shell
        gpadmin@gpmaster$ gpscp -v -f seghostfile hive-site.xml =:/etc/pxf/usercfg/servers/default/hive-site.xml
        ```

3. If you plan to use the PXF HBase connector to access HBase table data, similarly copy HBase configuration to each Greenplum Database segment host.
    
    1. Copy the `hbase-site.xml` HBase configuration file from one of the hosts on which your HBase service is running to the current host. For example:

        ``` shell
        gpadmin@gpmaster$ scp hbaseuser@hbasehost:/etc/hbase/conf/hbase-site.xml .
        ```

    2. Next, copy the `hbase-site.xml` configuration file to each Greenplum Database segment host. For example:

        ``` shell
        gpadmin@gpmaster$ gpscp -v -f seghostfile hbase-site.xml =:/etc/pxf/usercfg/servers/default/hbase-site.xml
        ```

4. PXF accesses Hadoop services on behalf of Greenplum Database end users. By default, PXF tries to access HDFS, Hive, and HBase using the identity of the Greenplum Database user account that logs into Greenplum Database. In order to support this functionality, you must configure proxy settings for Hadoop, as well as for Hive and HBase if you intend to use those PXF connectors. Follow procedures in [Configuring User Impersonation and Proxying](pxfuserimpers.html) to configure user impersonation and proxying for Hadoop services, or to turn off PXF user impersonation.

5. Grant read permission to the HDFS files and directories that will be accessed as external tables in Greenplum Database. If user impersonation is enabled (the default), you must grant this permission to each Greenplum Database user/role name that will use external tables that reference the HDFS files. If user impersonation is not enabled, you must grant this permission to the `gpadmin` user.

6. If your Hadoop cluster is secured with Kerberos, you must configure PXF and generate Kerberos principals and keytabs for each segment host as described in [Configuring PXF for Secure HDFS](pxf_kerbhdfs.html).


## <a id="client-cfg-update"></a>Updating Hadoop Configuration

If you update your Hadoop, Hive, or HBase configuration while the PXF service is running, you must copy the updated `.xml` file(s) to each Greenplum Database segment host and restart PXF on each host.
